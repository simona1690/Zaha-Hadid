            <h1>Byography</h1>
            <p>Zaha Hadid was a groundbreaking Iraqi-born British architect and designer. The first woman to win the Pritzker Prize for Architecture in 2004, 
                Hadid’s work was exemplified by its dynamic use of curved forms.
                Her iconic buildings focused on changing the public’s spatial concepts—not only physically but culturally and socially as well—attempting to liberate the architectural world from harsh geometric forms. 
                “Of course I believe imaginative architecture can make a difference to people's lives,” she once explained. 
                “But I wish it was possible to divert some of the effort we put into ambitious museums and galleries into the basic architectural building blocks of society.
                ” Born on October 31, 1950 in Baghdad, Iraq, Hadid was mainly educated at boarding schools in England and Switzerland. 
                After receiving a degree in mathematics from the American University of Beirut, she moved to England to study at the Architectural Association in London.
                At school she worked under Rem Koolhaas and Bernard Tschumi, graduating in 1977. In 1980, now a naturalized British citizen, she opened her own architecture firm in London.
                  Over the decades that followed, she taught at universities around Europe and the United States while also producing a number of impressive structures. 
                  Some of her most acclaimed buildings include the Vitra Fire Station (1991–1993) in Weil am Rhein Germany, the Riverside Museum (2004–2011) in Glasgow, the Guangzhou Opera House (2011), and the London Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.
                  Her career was cut short when she died unexpectedly of a heart attack on March 31, 2016 in Miami, FL.
